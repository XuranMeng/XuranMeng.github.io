I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan. My research interests lie in random matrix theory, high-dimensional statistics and machine learning theory. As a postdoc, I’m focused on exploring new insights and developing innovative approaches in these areas. On this website, you can see details about my research projects, publications and academic activities.
