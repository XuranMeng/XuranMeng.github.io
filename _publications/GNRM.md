While deep neural networks (DNNs) are  used for prediction, inference on DNN-estimated subject-specific means for categorical or exponential family outcomes remains underexplored. We address this by proposing a DNN estimator under  generalized nonparametric regression models (GNRMs) and developing a rigorous inference framework. Unlike existing approaches that assume independence between estimation errors and inputs to establish the error bound, a condition often violated in GNRMs, we allow for dependence and  our theoretical analysis demonstrates the feasibility of drawing inference under GNRMs.  To implement inference, we consider an Ensemble Subsampling Method (ESM) that leverages U-statistics and the Hoeffding decomposition to construct reliable confidence intervals for DNN estimates. We show that,  under  GNRM settings,  ESM enables model-free variance estimation and accounts for heterogeneity among individuals in the population. Through  simulations under nonparametric logistic, Poisson, and binomial regression models, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. We further apply the method to the electronic  Intensive Care Unit (eICU) dataset, a large scale collection of anonymized health records from ICU patients, to predict ICU readmission risk and offer patient-centric insights for clinical decision making.
