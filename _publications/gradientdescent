collection: publications

excerpt: 'In this paper, we explore the per- example gradient regularization (PEGR) and present a theoretical analysis that demonstrates its effectiveness in improving both test error and robustness against noise perturbations. Specifically, we adopt a signal-noise data model from Cao et al. (2022) and show that PEGR can learn signals effectively while suppressing noise. In contrast, standard gradient descent struggles to distinguish the signal from the noise, leading to suboptimal generalization performance. Our analysis reveals that PEGR penalizes the variance of pattern learning, thus effectively suppressing the memorization of noises from the training data.'
