excerpt: 'In this study, we mainly discuss the robust signal recovery by l1−2 minimisation with incorporating prior support information, which is not considered in previous works. A robust recovery condition is established and an recovery error estimation is obtained, in particular, the obtained results generalise the state-of-the-art ones. In addition, by proposing a modified algorithm, the numerical experiments show that incorporating prior support information for l1−2 minimisation exhibits better recovery performance than standard l1−2 minimisation.'
