excerpt: 'In this paper, we identify the difficulty of the classification problem as an important factor for the appearance of HT in weight matrices spectra. Higher the classification difficulty, higher the chance for HT to appear. Moreover, the classification difficulty can be affected either by the signal- to-noise ratio of the dataset, or by the complexity of the classification problem (complex features, large number of classes) as well. Leveraging on this finding, we further propose a spectral criterion to detect the appearance of HT and use it to early stop the training process without testing data. Such early stopped DNNs have the merit of avoiding overfitting and unnecessary extra training while preserving a much comparable generalization ability.'
